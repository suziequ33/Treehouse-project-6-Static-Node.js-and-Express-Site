 treehouse project 6
Created a portfolio site to showcase the great projects I have built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info, practice my elevator pitch and show the first five projects from this Tech degree. 
created a JSON file store all the data about the projects created.
Use Pug to provide templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser.

changed the background-color in layout.pug for body/sidebar.
also changed the background-color in index.pug for portfolio. that one was fun moving it around to find what one will fill the page. 
also changed the background-color and font in the info box to make it darker to read better.
