extends layout.pug 

block content 
    .error-page 
        h2 Oops, something went wrong!! 
        if error.status 
            p Status: #{error.status}
        p #{error.message}

        //-i made an error.pug page not for the extra credit. I couldnt figure out how to not do it and stil throw the errors. So i did what we learned and made a error.pug. Then it worked.
